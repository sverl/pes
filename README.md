pes - Potential energy surface diagrams
===================================================

The `pes` package defines an environment for easy typesetting og potential energy surface diagrams. The packages has a simple command for adding ground states and transition states. The package is very simple which makes it easy to extend to more specific or advanced uses.

Installation
------------

The package is supplied in `.dtx` format. To unpack the `.dtx`, run `tex pes.dtx` to extract the package whereas `latex pes.dtx` will extract it and also typeset the documentation.

The package requires LaTeX3 support as provided in the `l3kernel` and `l3packages` bundles. Both of these are available on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/) as ready-to-install `.zip` files.

The `.dtx` file has been adapted from Joseph Wright's [`notes2bib`](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/notes2bib) package.
